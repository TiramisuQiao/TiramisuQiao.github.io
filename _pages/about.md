大家好！我是王俊桥，欢迎来到我的个人主页～

# About Me 👋

🎓 Hello! I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Sichuan University – Pittsburgh Institute**, where I receive a fully international, English-based education. During the winter recess period, I had the opportunity to spend **a month** at the **University of Texas at Austin** as part of an exchange program. 

🧪 Currently, I am an intern at the **Shanghai AI Laboratory** in the **Medical Foundation Model Evaluation Group**, working on research related to **medical agents** under the mentorship of **Dr. Rongzhao Zhang**. At the same time, I am conducting research on **cryptocurrency agent-based trading strategies** at the quantitative firm **TrueNorth**, under the guidance of **Dr. Alex Lee**.  

🎯 In 2026, I will pursue graduate studies at the **School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, advised by **Prof. Lichi Zhang**, focusing on **medical imaging** and **multimodal medical models**.
