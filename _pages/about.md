# About Me

Hello! I am an undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Sichuan University – Pittsburgh Institute**, where I receive a fully international, English-based education.  

Currently, I am an intern at the **Shanghai AI Laboratory** in the **Medical Foundation Model Evaluation Group**, working on research related to **medical agents** under the mentorship of **Dr. Rongzhao Zhang**. At the same time, I am conducting research on **cryptocurrency agent-based trading strategies** at the quantitative firm **TrueNorth**, under the guidance of **Dr. Alex Lee**.  

In 2026, I will pursue graduate studies at the **School of Biomedical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**, advised by **Prof. Lichi Zhang**, focusing on **medical imaging** and **multimodal medical models**.

# Research Interests

Thanks to the supercomputing resources at Shanghai AI Lab, my research interests are broad and diverse, including but not limited to:

- Deep neural networks for **classification** and **segmentation**  
- **Reinforcement learning** for agents  
- **Inference optimization** for large models  
- **Multimodal large models**  

My long-term vision is to accelerate **AI empowerment in vertical domains**, especially in **healthcare** and **biomedicine**—to advance scientific discovery, improve healthcare capabilities in developing regions, and ultimately enable AI to bring real benefits to human health and society.
